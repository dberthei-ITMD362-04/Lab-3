# Lab-3: Form Styling and Web Fonts

This lab will build on existing CSS, including its baseline grid and typographic (modular) scale, to design a mobile-scale form that uses only shades of grey (no solid borders) for the input regions. It will favor an open design with plenty of padding and white space. 

It will inlcude a font-family with a robust font stack (3 fonts deep) made up of commonly available system fonts.
